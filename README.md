Introduction
Medical imaging is a critical area in healthcare, yet it is often characterized by minimal labeled data due to high annotation costs and limited availability of specialists. This project aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging quantum computing capabilities with classical contrastive learning techniques. Quantum Contrastive Fusion combines supervised contrastive learning’s effective feature representation with a quantum-enhanced classifier, potentially outperforming classical models in medical imaging classification.

The proposed model was tested on PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST, representative of real-world applications with low labeled data availability. Integrating Qiskit, Aqua, PennyLane, and Scikit-Learn, this work is at the forefront of quantum machine learning applications in healthcare.

Model Overview
Supervised Contrastive Learning
Contrastive learning is employed in this model to optimize feature representations by pulling similar samples closer and pushing dissimilar samples further apart in the embedding space. This method is highly effective for learning from limited labels, as it utilizes all labeled samples per batch for representation enhancement, thus amplifying the quantum model’s discriminatory power.

Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)
The Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) operates as the core quantum model, capitalizing on Qiskit’s variational circuit-based learning. This classifier leverages parameterized quantum circuits to adaptively learn data distributions, making it effective in high-dimensional spaces where classical models often struggle.

Quantum Contrastive Fusion
In Quantum Contrastive Fusion, contrastive learning is applied as a pre-training step, while the VQC takes advantage of the contrastively enhanced representations to perform final classification. The dimensionality is reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), optimizing the model’s computational efficiency. By combining the classical and quantum approaches, the model achieves remarkable accuracy in medical classification tasks.
